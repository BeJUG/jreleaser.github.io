= Sponsors

Do you or your company use JReleaser? You can help keep the project snappy and feature rich by sponsoring the project and its maintainers.

== GitHub Sponsors

GitHub Sponsors is a great way to contribute directly to the main maintainer, link:https://github.com/aalmiray[aalmiray].

This money usually goes to buying chocolate, better hardware, and, hopefully, one day, paying the bills.

get better tools to continue his work.
